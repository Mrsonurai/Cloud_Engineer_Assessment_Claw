# Cloud Engineer Assessment Submission
## Problem Statement

### The task requires demonstrating proficiency in key areas essential for a Cloud Engineer role. Specifically, it involves:

    Task 1: Setting up a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure, deploying an Ubuntu VM, configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs) for SSH access, and ensuring public access to HTTP and HTTPS. Additional requirements include enabling Azure Security Center and configuring a custom DNS server.

    Task 2: Creating an Azure storage account, setting up Azure CLI on an Ubuntu VM, and uploading an index.html file to a container.

    Task 3: Forking a GitHub repository, deploying a Flask application on the VM, creating a system service to ensure the application starts on reboot, and configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy for the application.

    Task 4: Using a provided script to install Apache on a VM, creating a snapshot, and using that snapshot to create two additional VMs. Configure a Load Balancer and Scaling group for these VMs.

    Task 5: Creating a GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployment of a Flask application to the VM. This includes modifying the application to display a custom message, running tests, and sending notifications to a Slack channel.

    Task 6: Answering questions about setting up Azure resources, configuring Azure File Shares, using Terraform, creating GitHub workflows, and securing the deployment process.
